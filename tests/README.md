# Simulation Models

This project utilizes various simulation models to study different fluid phenomena. Below is a list of the available models:

    ## 1) Splash

        ### a) Description
        The Splash model simulates the fall of a single cube of particles into a box containing a floor, walls, and a ceiling. 

        ### b) Forces used 
        **Only gravity**, pressure effects between fluid particles, and artificial viscosity are taken into account.

        ### c) Expectation
        The cube is supposed to crash on the floor and splah on the walls

    ## 2) Surface Tension

        ### a) Description
        The Surface Tension model simulates a single cube of particles in a **vacuum**. 

        ### b) Forces used
        **No gravity** is considered, so only pressure, viscosity, and surface tension forces are taken into account. 

        ### c) Expectation
        We expect the cube to become a perfect sphere.
