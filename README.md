# PI_Luca_Killian



## What is it about ?

This multiphysics integrated computational project is focused on computational fluid dynamics in continuum mechanic and more precisely focused on the **Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics** (so-called SPH method) which is computed in c++ language. This method has been created in the 19's (1977 by Gingold, Monaghan and Lucy) and is thus relatively new. Hence, one specificaly focus on microfluidic applications (such as surface tensions, adhesions) in order to compare our results to some well known examples to assess the accuracy of our models.

## How to run the code ?

### Before launching simulation
Once all files are downloaded, few things have to be considered before running simulations. Indeed, this c++ code is compiled using CMake (to ease the use of makefiles) and Ninja (to ease the access to files/folders' name) and thus some variables have to be defined before hand.

Windows : In the upper path of the folder **PI_LUCA_KILLIAN** write in a terminal
    ```envs\windows.cmd```

which will first set the location of mingw compiler/zlib/cmake; create mandatory local environment variables and immediatly shift your path to the desired location (in the build folder).

### Define simulation
In the **.json** file, several parameters can be adjusted:
    - thermodynamics variables (temperature, density, R, heat capacity ratio, ...)
    - particles (either fluid particles or fixed particles)
    - state equation between pressure and density (ideal gaz law or quasi incompressible fluid)
    - initial density (either same density for all fluid particles either density respecing hydrostatic law)

The particles can be generated by the use of "parallelipepidic bunch of particles" (rectangle full of particles) where the width, heigh and lengh of the rectangle can be modified (it can become a simple wall with a unitary thickness)
